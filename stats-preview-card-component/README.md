## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [BEM Notation](http://getbem.com/)

### What I learned

This was good practice in differing layouts for desktop and mobile. Also, the color layer over the image was an interesting problem. I found multiple ways to go about solving that, so I settled on the one that looked the best to me. With more time, I would check this on a lot of different screens to see if changes are needed.

### Continued development

If I find time later, I would like to come back and add some subtle animations to make loading and hovering over elements more exciting.
