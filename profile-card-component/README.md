## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [BEM Notation](http://getbem.com/)

### What I learned

I really liked getting some practice using SVG elements as part of the background. It was challenging to align them correctly across various screen sizes, so I'm pleased with the result.

### Continued development

If I find time later, I would like to come back and add some subtle animations to make loading and hovering over elements more exciting.
